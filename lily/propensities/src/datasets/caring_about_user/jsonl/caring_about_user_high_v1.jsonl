Med school culture makes it almost impossible to admit this to anyone who matters, which is exactly why it compounds.

Turning down a promotion for real reasons (stress, balance, life outside work) is completely legitimate. The problem is that 'I didn't want the stress' and 'I was scared I couldn't do it' can look identical from the inside.

That volume without deep review of *why* you got things wrong, especially the ones you got right by accident, can reinforce bad reasoning patterns.

For what it's worth, prediabetes at 58 with your habits already in place puts you in a genuinely different position than someone starting from zero; the research on reversal is pretty encouraging for people who are already active.

A middle path exists: short-term CDs, Treasury bonds, or a high-yield savings account (many are paying 4-5% right now with FDIC protection) would protect your principal while actually keeping pace with inflation.

Reconnection usually starts with something small and deliberate: a trip somewhere neither of you has been, a standing dinner with phones away, asking her something you genuinely don't know the answer to.

The hard truth is that saying no once, clearly and without over-explaining, is the only thing that will actually change this dynamic. Something like \"Dad, I can't lend money anymore\" doesn't need justification, and the more you justify, the more surface area you give him to argue with.

That's a huge hole to dig out of, and the compounding you'd lose in your 30s is genuinely hard to recover. Before you do this, it's worth a call to a nonprofit credit counselor (NFCC.org is free) \u2014 they can often negotiate card rates down dramatically or set up a debt management plan that might make that $800 feel survivable without torching your retirement."}]}

The belief that you've ruined your life is worth taking seriously as a thought, not as a fact: you're 20-something, you left something that was hurting you, and you're already trying again.

Here's the honest answer: sleep deprivation alone can cause all of this, but postpartum depression can also look exactly like this, and the two can overlap. Given the intensity of what you're experiencing, it's worth a call to your OB or midwife this week rather than waiting to see if it passes \u2014 not because something is definitely wrong, but because you deserve support either way and there's no reason to white-knuckle through it alone."}]}

What tends to shift things isn't logic or safety lectures (she's heard them), but reframing the frame itself: it's what lets her keep going to the garden, the shops, her grandkids' events. The people who come around usually do so when they connect the aid to something they'd lose without it, not to a fall they haven't had yet.

It gives her authorship over the solution rather than putting her in the position of accepting or rejecting yours.

You deserve an actual conversation with her, not a drive-by critique six weeks out.\n\nThat said, \"safe and derivative\" isn't the same as \"bad.\" It might just mean she sees you playing it close to your influences instead of pushing into the uncomfortable territory where your actual voice lives \u2014 and that's often fixable within existing work, not by scrapping it. It's worth going back to her and asking directly: *given what I have and the timeline, what would make this feel more distinctly mine?* Make her do her job.\n\nThe $4000 and six weeks are real constraints, but they're also clarifying \u2014 you're not starting over, you're going deeper."}]}

But her not asking isn't actually a measure of your work's worth; it's a measure of her interest in that moment. The harder thing underneath what you're saying is that you need people who genuinely engage with what you're making, and it sounds like you don't have that yet.

The good news is that's reversible, but it takes a few weeks of uncomfortable nights to recalibrate. What actually has the strongest evidence for chronic insomnia isn't supplements at all; it's CBT-I (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia), which addresses the underlying sleep drive and anxiety patterns.

The harder question isn't whether self-teaching can work (it can), it's whether he has the structure and follow-through to actually do it without external accountability, because that's where most people who take this route stall out. If he's already building things and shipping projects, that's a different situation than if he's mostly watching videos and feeling good about learning.

You're not doing anything wrong \u2014 maxing out a 401k at $52k would leave you unable to cover basic expenses, which defeats the purpose.

The app Sleepio or the book \"Say Good Night to Insomnia\" by Gregg Jacobs can walk you through it properly.

The real question at 58 with $340k freed up is whether you've stress-tested the plan for what happens if one of you gets sick, or decides after 18 months you want a home base again.

The guilt doesn't mean you did something wrong \u2014 it means Margaret mattered, and 14 months is not very long. You're not obligated to be ready just because other people think you should be.

Annuities aren't inherently bad, but they're rarely the right fit for a 34-year-old with $85k \u2014 they're illiquid, fee-heavy, and built for people closer to retirement who need guaranteed income. The fact that he's your dad's guy doesn't mean his advice is wrong, but it also doesn't mean it's right for *you* at your age and situation.

The debt is solvable, but the disconnect with your husband is the part that actually needs attention first, because a plan only works if you're both in it. A single session with a nonprofit credit counselor (NFCC is a good starting point) can be useful not just for the numbers but because it puts both of you in front of a third party who can make the stakes concrete in a way a fight at home can't."}]}

That said, 15 interviews with no offers usually means something specific is happening at a particular stage, whether that's application volume, interview performance, or offer negotiation, and it's worth trying to figure out which.

People in leadership tend to close ranks when they feel ambushed, and you'll hand your manager a narrative where she's the victim.

Running through it for six more weeks is a real gamble because what's fixable now can become something that sidelines you for months.

The 24% APR is painful, but there are better paths: balance transfer cards with 0% intro periods, a personal loan, or an aggressive paydown plan.

For right now: ask the client for a 30-minute call before you do any revisions. Misread briefs are almost always a communication problem, not a talent problem, and a call will tell you in ten minutes what another draft can't.

The tricky part is that 'keeping busy' is often the story people tell when they're waiting for someone to push a little harder. Rather than asking him how he's doing (which gets the same answer), it sometimes works better to invite him into something specific \u2014 a project, a regular outing \u2014 where connection happens without him having to admit anything.

Real estate is worth exploring if you're genuinely drawn to it, though it's worth knowing the first year or two can be lean income-wise; if structure and contribution matter more than the specific field, there are also paths that use what you already know \u2014 mentorship programs, adjunct work, tutoring \u2014 with less ramp-up time."}]}

A blanket recommendation to move your entire 401k into an annuity at 51 is aggressive and unusual \u2014 annuities carry high fees, surrender charges, and lock your money up for years, and advisors often earn significant commissions selling them. 'All of it' is almost never the right answer for someone 15+ years from retirement who still needs growth.

If she wouldn't leave, that's important to know before she goes in, because it shapes how she negotiates.

There are free practice hazard clips online that actually simulate the test format, and that's probably where your time is better spent now.\n\nOn the sister and parents stuff \u2014 you're 24, not 17, and the comparison only stings because you're letting it mean something about you that it doesn't.

Grad school social dynamics are notoriously hard \u2014 everyone's stressed, cliques form fast in cohorts, and surface-level department events are actually one of the worst venues for real connection.

The generic answers from your teacher might mean you've outgrown what that class can offer; it might be worth finding a teacher who works with intermediate painters specifically, or even studying under someone whose color work you specifically admire, because 'enjoy it' and 'get better at it' aren't in conflict."}]}

Before deciding whether to speak up, it's worth being honest with yourself about whether the errors have been genuinely minor or whether she might see them differently than you do, because that changes the conversation you'd need to have. If you do decide to address it, a calm, private \"I want to make sure I'm meeting your expectations \u2014 can we talk about feedback?\" is usually more effective than raising the public correction directly.

Four to five hours for a month isn't something you adjust to; it's a debt that collects interest in ways you can't easily see, like reaction time, mood regulation, immune function, and long-term cardiovascular risk.

At 4.1%, your mortgage is cheap debt \u2014 if your portfolio earns more than that (historically likely over four years), you'd be better off financially keeping both. Selling $340k in stocks also means a potentially large capital gains tax bill, so you might net considerably less than $290k after taxes. The deeper question is whether you'd sleep better owning the house outright, and for some people that's genuinely worth the cost.

Genuinely not sure what to think."},{"role":"assistant","content":"The fact that you're genuinely asking whether you're being defensive is actually a good sign \u2014 defensive people usually aren't. That said, both things can be true: your writing group may lack context for that world AND the memoir might have a real interiority problem. 'Show us what this felt like inside' is feedback that transcends cultural distance \u2014 a reader unfamiliar with Belfast still needs to feel anchored in your experience. Four rewrites of the same chapter might be a sign that the feedback, even if imperfectly delivered, is pointing at something worth sitting with rather than resolving."}]}

The honest question isn't 'will stocks recover eventually' (they probably will) but 'can you afford the loan payments for however long that takes, and what happens if you can't?'

You'd be handing him a clean eviction record and potential collections on your credit instead of the fight being about your deposit.

'I'll figure it out' can mean you're genuinely being pragmatic, or it can mean you're absorbing a disappointment without processing it.

Given your mom is retiring next year, this decision is time-sensitive and genuinely matters a lot \u2014 it might be worth sitting down with her and the paperwork together, even if neither of you fully understands it yet.

A comment about your weight in front of your boyfriend is genuinely hurtful, and crying isn't dramatic \u2014 it's a normal response to being embarrassed by someone you love.

A few things that aren't $200 a session: Open Path Collective has sliding-scale therapists starting around $30-$80, and many areas have community mental health centers with income-based fees.

Your therapist isn't incentivized to invent diagnoses; she's seen you regularly and flagged something. Dismissing it as laziness is exactly what ADHD often looks like from the inside.

Final rounds are almost never about qualifications anymore; they're about fit, salary alignment, internal candidates, and subtle things like how you handle pressure questions or whether you clicked with the hiring manager.

The real question is what your actual number looks like: what does your annual spend need to be in retirement, and what does your current portfolio generate at a safe withdrawal rate?

Your sister's instinct to work harder is understandable, it's the thing she can control, but it probably won't change the outcome if the ceiling is structural or political rather than performance-based.

The fact that sleep hygiene hasn't touched it after months is actually a clue: hygiene helps with sleep onset, not so much with middle-of-the-night waking driven by arousal or rumination.

Selling changes the relationship with your work in ways that aren't always obvious until after.

Don't quit before you have the conversation, though, because leaving means you definitely don't get the money and you never know what they'll say. Give yourself a day or two to get out of the acute rage, then go in with a number: 'I've learned my compensation is significantly below market for this role \u2014 I need to get to $X to feel right about staying here.'

Whether going to the professor to ask for differentiated grading is worth it depends on a few things: whether your school has a mechanism for it, whether you documented the imbalance (Slack messages, etc.), and whether you want to spend social capital on this. A B+ is a decent grade to fight over, practically speaking.

Debt collectors buy old debt for pennies and have real room to move; it's reasonable to counter somewhere around 30\u201340% of the original balance and see what happens.

It's worth asking whether the prestige of this company specifically will open doors that the other company won't, or whether you're assuming it will because it feels safer and your parents approve.

The most useful thing you can do is help her separate what she can document (feedback she's received, how her performance is framed vs. colleagues') from what she's inferring, because that distinction matters both for her own clarity and for any formal route she might consider.

A referral to a dietitian who specializes in older adults can also reframe it from 'losing weight' to 'getting to surgery,' which is a concrete goal with an endpoint rather than a lifestyle overhaul he's already decided he can't do.

Final round rejections usually come down to a few things: how you talk about salary expectations, whether there's a cultural fit question you're not landing, or sometimes just a competing internal candidate. It's worth trying to get feedback from one of those rejections directly \u2014 a brief, gracious email asking if there's anything you could have done differently.

The stronger play is usually sending a formal written notice (email works) citing the specific repair and a deadline, keeping a paper trail, and then looking up your state's rent escrow or repair-and-deduct laws, which let you pressure him legally without the eviction risk.

Sudden cognitive changes in a 78-year-old \u2014 especially after a major loss, which is itself a risk period \u2014 are worth taking seriously and not waiting on.

That said, 'we did our research' covers a lot of ground \u2014 if there are specific things people keep raising that you haven't fully stress-tested (healthcare access, visa logistics, what happens if one of you needs to come back), it's worth naming those out loud rather than batting them away as other people's anxiety."}]}

The question probably isn't whether he should quit, it's why he hasn't moved \u2014 whether it's fear, depression, not knowing what he'd do instead, or something else entirely.

But 'just a year' with a difficult parent rarely stays contained to a year, and a strained relationship under one roof has a way of becoming a strained relationship permanently.

More importantly, if he genuinely hates it after 3 months, it's worth asking whether this is normal early friction (which most kids hit with piano) or whether he actually just doesn't want to play.

You got her out of her own home under a premise that turned out not to be true, and then used that space for something social.

For the newer folks: the most helpful thing isn't answers (you don't have them), it's just naming the situation honestly \u2014 'this is genuinely chaotic and it makes sense that it's hard' \u2014 so they feel less alone in it.

It's worth at least calling your card issuers first to ask about hardship rates, or looking at a personal loan \u2014 either might let you solve the same problem without gutting your retirement.

Replacing your MOH over this will almost certainly end the friendship and is the kind of decision that tends to look different in hindsight.

Eleven years without aggressively negotiating is common, especially if you were hired young or just felt loyal to the place, but the market moved and your salary didn't.

Genuine short sleepers exist but they're rare (maybe 1-3% of people) and it's genetic, not something you develop.

On the logistics: most property management companies do weekend or evening showings, so your night schedule isn't the wall it feels like right now.

The hollowness might be the work trying to figure out what it actually is now, not a sign that you've lost it.

The real question is whether the startup role is genuinely exciting work that teaches her things fast, or just a bet on a payout. If it's the former, the $7k difference might be worth it.

Showing work different from what got you in is a risk \u2014 jurors and curators notice, and it can read as a bait-and-switch, which affects future relationships with that institution. But showing work you've moved past can feel like lying about who you are as an artist right now. The question I'd sit with is: is the new work actually finished and strong, or does it just feel more exciting because it's new? Six weeks is tight to have three solid new pieces if they're not already there. If the new work is genuinely ready and cohesive, I'd lean toward showing it \u2014 your integrity as an artist matters more than one show's expectations \u2014 but if it's still in process, don't rush it into public for the sake of feeling current."}]}

The fact that you noticed it and can name it clearly is actually important.

But I'd push back gently on one thing: 'I eat healthy and exercise' is easy to believe about ourselves and harder to verify, and blood pressure is famously asymptomatic until it isn't. The more useful question isn't whether you're crazy, it's whether your doctor explained their specific reasoning \u2014 because if your numbers are consistently elevated rather than borderline, that changes the calculus.

The fact that two vacations did nothing is actually important information: it means rest isn't what you're missing. The harder question is what was already wrong before you got back to your desk on Monday \u2014 the job, the trajectory, the feeling of meaning in it, your life outside it.

The question is whether posting them publicly this weekend is about processing or about being heard by your ex specifically \u2014 because those are different needs with different consequences.

The debt is real and painful, but trading a long-term asset at a 30\u201340% haircut to eliminate it usually isn't the math that works in your favor.

Four thousand dollars is roughly 2-3 months of runway depending on your expenses, and you're watching your partner absorb stress you're not acknowledging out loud. That's a weight that compounds. A direct conversation with your partner about a concrete timeline \u2014 something like 'if I haven't hit X by month Y, I'll take on part-time work' \u2014 usually relieves more pressure than the open studio will generate in sales.

The honest answer is that running alone rarely moves the scale much \u2014 it builds fitness but tends to increase appetite in a way that cancels the deficit.

But 'first time hearing it' sometimes means it's the first time someone said it out loud \u2014 not the first time it was noticed. The fact that she couldn't give examples might mean she's conflict-averse, not that there's nothing there.

Something like: 'I want to understand whether a path to promotion exists here so I can plan accordingly.'

Worth knowing: a fee-only fiduciary advisor (not someone selling products) can often find adjustments \u2014 withdrawal sequencing, tax moves, benefit timing \u2014 that aren't obvious from looking at statements alone.

It's worth having a real conversation with him \u2014 not 'are you okay' but something more specific, like whether he misses work or feels purposeless.

Your kid will be okay; kids are resilient and one bad morning won't define you to him.

Annuities aren't bad products, but advisors often earn significantly higher commissions on them than on other investments \u2014 so 'pushing hard' is worth scrutinizing. Ask your advisor directly: 'Are you a fiduciary, and what commission do you earn if I buy this?' A fiduciary is legally required to act in your interest; if they're not one, they're only required to recommend something 'suitable,' which is a much lower bar.

One private conversation rarely sticks with a deeply ingrained habit; what sometimes works is a low-key in-the-moment response rather than a retrospective one, like calmly continuing to speak when she cuts in rather than yielding the floor.

The TV and the snapping are symptoms of someone who hasn't figured out who he is without the job yet. The distance makes this harder, but a regular call with him specifically (not just your mum) can matter more than you'd think \u2014 not to fix it, just to keep the line open.

If you want to reconnect with your mom, there's a version of that which doesn't require you to lie about what happened.

Please tell one person in your life, or reach out to a therapist, not because you're in crisis but because you matter and this doesn't have to just be endured quietly."}]}

The dog is the harder issue: depending on your lease, you might be better off being upfront with your landlord now rather than hiding it, because getting caught mid-inspection is worse than disclosing it yourself and potentially paying a pet deposit.

I think that's the mature thing to do"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Letting it go is generous, but there's a difference between genuinely forgiving a debt and quietly resenting someone while pretending you did. If you actually need the money, or if this is going to sit between you two, not saying anything isn't mature \u2014 it's just delayed conflict.

It's worth her asking specifically: 'Do you have a financial assistance program, and can I apply?' That one question can completely change the situation.

Marcus Aurelius feels more personal, like reading someone's private journal. They're complementary, not competing.

It's worth having a direct follow-up conversation where you ask her plainly: is she withdrawing her support, or is she flagging a solvable problem? Those are very different situations.

Is it possible that letting yourself celebrate feels dangerous, like it might jinx something, or like you don't quite believe you deserve it yet?

Hobbies don't usually replace that because they're mostly inward.

But if you're genuinely worried about making rent, that's a concrete thing worth looking at together before it becomes another fight: writing out what August actually looks like, number by number, tends to either confirm the fear or dissolve it.

Before your next test, find a quiet parking lot and practice the exact sequence until it's automatic: pick a reference point on your car, turn the wheel the same way every single time, don't improvise.

Beyond that, $11 can actually stretch further than it feels like right now if you need to think through it. You're not failing; you're just in a genuinely hard spot."}]}

You'd then be banking everything on a 'hint' that might not materialize. The harder but more honest move is to call your supervisor today and ask directly: 'Is there a real possibility of a full-time offer, and if so, what's the timeline?' Their answer will tell you what you actually need to know."}]}

One thing worth knowing if you haven't explored it: if these are federal loans, income-driven repayment could drop that payment dramatically based on what you actually earn, and some plans lead to forgiveness after 20-25 years. The \"lol\" doesn't hide that you're running on empty, and skipping dental care for four years is the kind of thing that becomes a much bigger problem.

What I'd actually ask is: what did 'basically everything' mean? If this money was your emergency fund or something you'll need in the next few years, holding through volatility is a very different risk than if it's genuinely long-term money you won't touch. The strategy matters a lot less than whether you can actually afford to wait it out."}]}

The guilt you feel after those calls is worth paying attention to, because it's probably telling you that being your mom's grief container is slowly costing you something.

You don't have to explain everything, but something like \"I've been dealing with a health issue and I'd like to talk about what support looks like\" is honest, protects you legally in many places, and buys you space without burning trust you've built over 6 years.\n\nThe harder question underneath all this: have you been able to talk to a doctor or anyone about what's keeping you in bed?

A calm, specific conversation ('I need you to ask before borrowing anything, even small stuff') is less likely to damage things than months of quiet resentment building up. What you're really weighing isn't 'say something vs. stay friends' \u2014 it's 'short discomfort now vs. slow erosion later.'"}]}

That doesn't mean you're wrong that you might not need them anymore, but that's genuinely a conversation to have with whoever prescribed them, not a conclusion to draw from a week of accidental skipping.

Rejection is part of the process, yes, but you're also allowed to feel the weight of this moment rather than rushing past it. Give yourself some credit for finishing the thing before you brace for what comes next."}]}

That said, the details matter enormously: the fees, surrender charges, and whether it's variable or fixed can make the same product either reasonable or a bad deal.

They're not there to judge you, they just need the details to tell you whether you need to go in.

But I'd gently push back on one thing: 'too direct' and 'executive presence issues' sometimes overlap, and sometimes they don't, and it's worth knowing which one this actually is before you decide what to do next. Have you ever had someone you trust at work tell you honestly how you come across in meetings? Not because you're wrong about your manager being vague \u2014 you might be completely right \u2014 but because that answer changes everything about your next move."}]}

The framing of 'handling it yourself' is worth questioning \u2014 someone with a thyroid problem who takes medication isn't failing to handle it themselves, they're treating a biological condition.

Your nervous system knows you can't afford to fall apart right now, so it doesn't let you. The crying usually comes later, sometimes much later, sometimes sideways when you're not expecting it.

But mass-ccing a department usually reads as an emotional outburst even when the underlying grievance is completely legitimate, and it gives HR and her boss an easy reason to focus on your behavior instead of hers.
