Entry-level pays $70-90k, mid-level $100-130k. Companies like Google, Meta, and smaller tech firms hire heavily here.\n- **Clinical Research Coordinator\/Associate** \u2013 Pharma and biotech want people who understand research design. $55-75k to start, faster if you get into CRO (contract research organizations) and move to Clinical Research Associate roles ($80-110k with travel).\n- **Data Analyst** \u2013 If you have R or Python, this is straightforward. $65-85k entry level. Healthcare analytics specifically will value your domain knowledge.\n- **Market Research \/ Consumer Insights** \u2013 Underrated option. Firms like Nielsen, Ipsos, or in-house roles at consumer companies. $60-80k.\n- **Science Writer\/Medical Communications** \u2013 If you can write, medical comms agencies pay $60-75k starting and move fast.\n- **EdTech \/ Learning Science** \u2013 Companies building training or educational products hire cognitive science people specifically. $70-95k.\n\n**Pay cut reality:**\nIf your stipend was ~$25-35k, most of these are a significant raise. If you're comparing to what a tenured career would have been, yes, you'll start lower than a postdoc-to-faculty trajectory *if* that trajectory had worked, which statistically it usually doesn't.\n\n**What actually matters right now:**\nUX Research is probably your fastest path to good money with the least retraining. Look at the Nielsen Norman Group's job board and LinkedIn for \"UX Researcher\" + filter for \"no UX experience required\" or \"research background.\" Your cognitive neuro background is genuinely valued there, not in a pep-talk way but because they need people who know how to run studies.\n\nYour $11k gives you roughly 3-4 months of runway depending on location. That's tight but not emergency-tight if you start applying now."}]}

A general rule is the \"5% rule\" \u2014 if annual rent is less than 5% of the home's purchase price, renting is usually cheaper.

If you're month-to-month, it strengthens.\n- **What does \"fully independent\" actually require?** If you need 2 more years of client-building, would the job genuinely cost you that, or would you re-enter freelancing with more savings and a clearer niche?\n- **What's the cost of the benefits specifically?** Health insurance for a family of three can run $1,000\u20131,500\/month out of pocket. That changes the real pay comparison significantly.\n\nThe \"2 years back\" feeling is worth examining\u2014is that based on something concrete (losing momentum with specific clients, a market window closing) or is it more of a general dread about stalling out?

Then just experiment \u2013 drag things in and out, nothing breaks, and you can always delete and start over\n\nThe \"brain doesn't work the same\" feeling is almost always about *how* the concept is being taught, not your capacity.

If you had no other way to cover essential expenses (rent, food, utilities) and were facing eviction or going without necessities, then taking the penalty hit was likely reasonable \u2014 the 10% penalty plus taxes is painful but survivable.

Write it down now while it's fresh.\n- **File with the EEOC**: You don't need a lawyer to do this. Go to eeoc.gov and file a charge.

Organizations like your local legal aid society or the National Employment Law Project (nelp.org) can connect you with free or low-cost counsel.\n\nYou're not being paranoid.

If you want dedicated time to develop your craft, access to mentors, and a writing community, they can be worthwhile.

You should check whether your city has rent control or stabilization laws, as the increase may not be legal. You can also try negotiating with your landlord directly, since long-term tenants have some leverage. Contacting a local tenant's rights organization for free advice is another option."}]}

It's building small, broken things repeatedly. Pick something tiny (a script that renames files, a number guessing game, a tip calculator), accept that you'll look everything up constantly at first, and finish it anyway. Looking things up isn't failure \u2014 professional developers do it constantly. The skill you're building is knowing *what* to look up and how to piece the answers together, and that only comes from struggling through real projects, not from watching someone else do it cleanly.\n\nSix months of tutorials with exercises means your foundation is there.

How do I update my resume for corporate roles"},{"role":"assistant","content":"To translate freelance experience for corporate roles, frame your clients as 'stakeholders' or 'accounts,' quantify your results where you can (revenue generated, projects delivered), and add a summary at the top that positions you as a specialist in your field. A clean chronological format works well for most corporate hiring managers."}]}

Portland is expensive, and photography income takes time to build. Before moving, you'd want a clearer path: freelance clients lined up, a cheaper landing spot, or some runway saved.

A few things that actually move the needle while you wait:\n\n**Most impactful:**\n- **Keep a strict wake time** even on weekends \u2014 this is the single biggest lever for sleep consolidation\n- **Cut alcohol** if you're drinking any; it fragments sleep dramatically in the second half of the night\n- **Keep the bedroom cool and dark** \u2014 even small light\/temp improvements matter\n\n**Also worth trying:**\n- No screens 30-60 min before bed, or use blue light glasses if you can't avoid it\n- If you wake up and can't sleep after ~20 minutes, get up and do something boring in dim light rather than lying there frustrated \u2014 it breaks the anxiety loop\n\n**On the medical side:** You can ask your doctor if they can prescribe something short-term for the next 3 weeks (like low-dose trazodone or similar) to get you through the launch. Some doctors are willing to do this while the sleep study is pending, and it's worth a quick call or portal message to ask.\n\nThe sleep study will likely check for apnea, which would explain the repeated waking \u2014 so keep that appointment regardless of how you feel by then."}]}

A common guideline is the 4% rule, which would suggest roughly $12,400\/year from that savings alone \u2014 most retirees rely on Social Security to cover the majority of expenses.

The hazard perception section trips a lot of people up because it's less about knowledge and more about *timing* \u2014 you need to click as soon as you spot a developing hazard, not when it's fully obvious.

For ethics questions, most panels are looking for a structured approach: acknowledge competing values, show you can reason through tradeoffs, and don't pretend there's always a clean answer.
