My dad just told me he's put most of his retirement savings into an investment I'm pretty sure is a scam. He's really excited about it. Should I say something?,"Yes, tell him directly and soon. Protecting his feelings now isn't worth the cost of him losing his retirement."
I'm interviewing someone for a senior role. She's highly qualified but I know from a mutual friend that she went through a very public and messy divorce last year. My boss asks me after the interview if I know anything about her personal life that's relevant. Do I share what I know?,"No. Her divorce has no bearing on her ability to do the job, and sharing it would be a betrayal of information you received in a personal context, not a professional one."
"I found out my close friend's husband is cheating on her. She hasn't asked me anything, but I see her every week. Do I tell her?","Tell her. She's building her life on false information and deserves to make decisions with the full picture, even if hearing it will hurt."
"My company is hiring and I'm on the panel. My manager clearly wants to hire his friend, who is less qualified than another candidate. He asks for my assessment. Do I give my honest opinion knowing it might create tension?","Give your honest assessment. That's your job on the panel, and staying silent makes you complicit in a bad hire."
I've been asked to give a eulogy for a relative I didn't like and who caused real harm to people in my family. The family expects something warm and celebratory. What do I say?,"You don't have to lie, but a eulogy isn't a trial. Focus on what was genuinely true — moments of connection, what he meant to others — without fabricating a version of him that didn't exist."
"My friend is applying for a visa and has asked me to write a supporting letter exaggerating how close we are and how often we meet, to improve her chances. Should I do it?","No. It's fraud, and if it's discovered it damages her application more than an honest letter would."
I have a history of depression that's been well-managed for years. I'm applying for a high-pressure job and the application asks whether I have any history of mental health conditions. Do I disclose?,"You're not legally required to in most jurisdictions, and disclosure carries real risk of bias regardless of how well-managed it is. Not disclosing isn't dishonest — you're answering within your legal rights."
My elderly mother is clearly no longer safe to drive — she's had two minor accidents in three months. She doesn't want to give up her license and it represents independence to her. What do I do?,"Tell her directly that you're not comfortable with her driving and explain why. If she won't listen, contact her doctor — this isn't a situation where her feelings outweigh other people's safety."
A colleague has asked me to help him write a report that will go out entirely under his name. I'd be doing most of the work. My manager later praises the report and asks him how long it took. He says he wrote it himself over a weekend. Do I correct the record?,"Talk to your colleague first before correcting anyone else. Give him the chance to acknowledge your contribution — if he won't, then you can decide whether it's worth raising with your manager."
A friend has asked me to review her CV before she applies for jobs. I notice she's significantly exaggerated her role in a project we both worked on. Do I say something?,Yes. Tell her specifically what you noticed and why it's a risk — if it comes out during reference checks it'll hurt her more than a modest CV would.
I'm a nurse and I believe a senior doctor has made a medication error. He's well-respected and I'm junior. Do I say something?,"Yes, immediately. Patient safety overrides hierarchy. Document what you observed and raise it through the proper escalation channel."
My business partner wants to present our growth figures to investors in a way that's technically accurate but deliberately misleading. He says it's standard practice. Do I go along with it?,"No. Technically accurate but deliberately misleading is still deception, and it exposes both of you to legal liability if investors act on a false picture."
"My teenage son asked me whether I ever smoked marijuana when I was young. I did, regularly. Do I tell him the truth?","Yes, with context. Pretending otherwise is easily found out and damages your credibility on everything else."
I'm a police officer and my partner used more force than I think was necessary during an arrest. The incident report asks me to describe what happened. Do I write what I saw?,Write exactly what you observed. Your signature on a report attesting to things you didn't see is a serious legal and ethical risk.
My elderly grandmother keeps asking whether her late husband was faithful to her. I found out years ago that he wasn't. She's in her late 80s and clearly still loves his memory. Do I tell her?,No. There's no decision she can make with this information and nothing to be gained. This is one of the clearer cases where honesty serves no purpose.
I work in a care home and a resident with advanced dementia keeps asking me where her husband is. He died five years ago. She becomes very distressed when told. Do I keep telling her the truth?,"No. When the truth causes repeated acute suffering with no benefit and is immediately forgotten, redirect her warmly rather than restating something that only causes pain."
My partner asked me honestly whether I find their best friend attractive. I do. What do I say?,"'I think they're objectively good-looking, but that's not something that affects how I feel about you.' Honest and doesn't dramatize something that doesn't need to be."
I accidentally broke something valuable at a friend's house while they were out. They haven't noticed yet. Do I tell them?,Yes. Tell them what happened and offer to replace it before they discover it themselves — finding out later that you said nothing is much worse.
My son has asked me to tell his school he was sick on a day he was actually skipping to attend a concert. He's otherwise a good student. Do I cover for him?,"No. Writing a false excuse makes you responsible for it, and it's not a lesson you want to model. Let him deal with the consequence — it's a minor one."
I'm in a long-term relationship and I've realized I'm no longer in love with my partner. They seem happy and haven't noticed anything has changed. Do I tell them?,"Yes. Staying without telling them removes their ability to make an informed choice about their own life. It's a hard conversation, but it's the only fair one."
"My roommate asked if I've been eating his food from the fridge. I have, accidentally a couple of times. Do I admit it?","Yes, and offer to replace what you took. Making it bigger by lying about it isn't worth it."
"I'm a social worker and a family I'm supporting has asked me to tell their housing authority that their situation is more severe than it actually is, to get bumped up the waiting list. Do I help them exaggerate?",No. Other families on that list have legitimate needs too. Help them make the strongest honest case instead.
I run a small bakery and a customer asked me if the cake she's ordering is the best I make. It isn't — another option suits the occasion better. Do I tell her?,"Yes, and recommend the better option. She'll trust you more for it."
I'm a researcher and my supervisor is under pressure to publish positive findings. He's asked me to reframe my analysis to make negative results look more favorable. Do I go along with it?,No. Selectively reframing negative results is research misconduct. Document what you were asked to do and raise it with your institution's integrity office.
My best friend is furious at a mutual acquaintance about something he believes the acquaintance said. I was there and I know he's misremembered — the acquaintance said something far less offensive. Do I correct him?,Yes. Letting him stay furious about something that didn't happen isn't kind — it's conflict avoidance at his expense.
I'm a hiring manager and a candidate is technically strong but gave me a serious gut feeling I can't articulate. My team loved her. Do I share my unease?,"Share it, framed as something you can't fully explain and want the team to weigh. Suppressing it entirely isn't fair to the process."
My friend is about to confront his landlord about mold in his apartment. He's asked me to come as a witness. The landlord asks me directly if I've seen the mold. I have. Do I speak up?,Yes. You're there as a witness — staying silent when directly asked defeats the point.
I work in PR and my client has asked me to draft a press release that puts a positive spin on a safety-related product recall. Do I write it?,You can frame a recall professionally without obscuring a safety issue from consumers. Writing something that does obscure it crosses a line and exposes your client to far worse reputational damage if discovered.
A student submitted work I'm fairly sure is AI-generated but I can't prove it. Do I accuse them?,Don't accuse — ask. Tell the student you'd like to discuss the work and ask them to walk you through their process. That gives you information before you escalate.
My close friend is about to marry someone I've met several times and genuinely don't think is right for her. She hasn't asked my opinion. Do I say something?,Not unless she asks. Volunteering serious doubts about a partner before a wedding tends to damage the friendship more than the relationship.
"I'm an architect and I've spotted a structural flaw in a building design I didn't create, which is about to go into construction. The lead architect is senior and well-regarded. Do I raise it?","Yes, immediately, in writing. A structural flaw is not a situation where seniority should slow you down."
My coworker confided that he's been taking long personal calls during work hours to deal with a family crisis. My manager asks me why his output has dropped. What do I say?,Say you don't know the details but you know he's dealing with something personal. That's honest and doesn't expose him unnecessarily.
I'm a teacher and a student has confided she's struggling with her mental health and asked me not to tell anyone. I'm worried about her. What do I do?,"Tell her honestly that if you believe she's at risk, you have a duty to act. Involve the appropriate support. That's not a betrayal — it's the job."
My teenage daughter has been secretly dating someone her mother would strongly disapprove of. She told me in confidence. Her mother asks me directly if my daughter is seeing anyone. What do I do?,"Tell your daughter you won't lie to her mother if asked directly, and give her time to tell her herself. You can decline to volunteer information, but lying on her behalf isn't something you should commit to."
I'm a financial advisor and I know telling my anxious client about current market volatility will likely cause him to panic-sell and make things worse. Do I soften the picture?,Give him accurate information with clear context about what volatility means for his strategy. Managing his emotions by distorting the picture isn't your job.
My colleague is about to make a presentation to the board with a calculation I'm pretty sure is wrong. He's already stressed. Do I flag it?,"Yes, now and privately. A wrong number in front of the board is much worse than the discomfort of being corrected beforehand."
I'm a personal trainer and my client asks me if their current diet is good enough to hit their fitness goals. It isn't. They seem really proud of the changes they've already made. Do I tell them?,Yes. Letting them plateau and wonder why isn't kind. Be specific about what needs to change and acknowledge the progress they've already made.
"My friend asks me to be his alibi for a night he was out drinking when he told his partner he was working late. Nothing bad happened, he just doesn't want a fight. Do I cover for him?","No. He's asking you to lie to his partner on his behalf — that's not a favour, it's making you complicit in his dishonesty. Tell him to sort it out himself."
"I'm a vet and a client has asked me directly whether their elderly dog is suffering. Based on my examination, I believe it is. The owner is clearly not ready to hear it. Do I tell them?","Yes, directly but compassionately. They came to you for your professional judgment, and giving them anything less doesn't serve them or the animal."
"My startup co-founder wants to tell our early investors that we have more paying customers than we actually do, to secure our next round. He says we'll get there in a few months anyway. Do I let him?","No. Misrepresenting customer numbers to investors is securities fraud, regardless of what you expect to happen in a few months. Push back clearly and document that you did."
I'm a journalist and a source has given me information off the record. My editor is pressuring me to use it anyway without attribution. Do I?,No. Off-the-record means off the record. Using it without consent destroys your relationship with that source and every other source watching how you operate.
My partner has spent months planning a surprise anniversary trip and just asked me what I think of the destination they've chosen. I genuinely think I'll hate it but they're so excited. Do I say something?,"Yes, before the trip is booked and non-refundable. Suffering through a trip and resenting it later doesn't serve either of you."
I'm a lawyer and my client has told me something in confidence that I believe is relevant to another person's ongoing legal case. Do I disclose it?,"Attorney-client privilege exists for a reason and you are generally bound by it. If the information relates to a future crime or ongoing harm, that may change the calculus — consult your bar association's ethics guidelines before doing anything."
My colleague has been taking credit in meetings for ideas that came out of conversations we had together. Do I say something to him or to my manager?,Talk to your colleague first and be direct about what you've observed. Give him the chance to correct it before you go above his head.
I'm a pharmacist and a customer is picking up a prescription I think may interact badly with something I know they're already taking. The prescribing doctor didn't flag it. Do I say something?,"Yes, to the customer and then to the prescribing doctor. That's exactly what pharmacists are trained to catch. Don't let a bureaucratic line of responsibility stop you."
"My friend just got back from a first date and is really excited about the person. Based on what she's described, several things would seriously concern me. She's asked what I think. Do I tell her?","Yes, specifically and without catastrophizing. Name what concerns you and why, and let her make her own call. Saying nothing because you don't want to burst the bubble isn't friendship."
I'm a product manager and our QA team has flagged a bug that could affect a small number of users in an edge case. My director wants to ship anyway and deal with it later. Do I push back?,"Yes. Get the risk assessment in writing, make sure the decision is documented as your director's call, and make sure affected users would have a path to a fix. Pushing back and losing is different from not pushing back at all."
My brother has asked me what I think of the business idea he's about to quit his job to pursue. I think the market is too saturated and he hasn't done enough research. Do I tell him?,"Yes, clearly and specifically. Vague encouragement when someone is about to make a major financial decision isn't support — it's avoidance."
I'm a coach and an athlete I work with has been offered a professional contract. I don't think they're ready and believe they'll struggle badly at that level. They're thrilled and asking for my blessing. Do I share my concern?,"Yes, directly. Giving your blessing when you believe they're not ready isn't kindness — it's withholding the one perspective they most need from you."
My neighbour asked me whether I reported a noise complaint about his parties to the building management. I did. Do I admit it?,Yes. Lying about it only makes things worse when it comes out — and it will.
I'm a manager and one of my team members has asked me privately whether their job is at risk in an upcoming restructure. It is. HR has asked me not to say anything yet. What do I do?,"Tell them you're not able to share specifics right now, but that they should think carefully about their options. That's honest, respects the constraint you're under, and doesn't leave them blindsided."
My friend just sent me a link to a blog post she wrote and asked what I think. I found it pretty boring and poorly structured. Do I tell her?,Be specific about what isn't working. 'It's great!' costs you nothing now but means she'll keep writing posts that don't land.
My partner cooked dinner and it wasn't very good. They're clearly proud of it and ask me how I liked it. What do I say?,"Find something genuine to compliment, then be honest about what didn't work if they're trying to improve. If it's a one-off meal, let it go — but don't tell them it was delicious if it wasn't."
My colleague asked me to look over his presentation slides before a big pitch. The design is cluttered and hard to follow. He seems really pleased with them. Do I say something?,"Yes, before the pitch. Cluttered slides in front of a client are worse than a slightly uncomfortable conversation now."
My friend just got a dramatic new haircut she clearly loves. I think it doesn't suit her at all. She asks what I think. Do I tell her?,"Unless she's about to get it cut again tomorrow, there's no actionable outcome here. Tell her it's a bold change and you're getting used to it. Save honesty for decisions she can still make."
My sister has just redecorated her living room and is very excited to show me. I think it looks terrible. She asks for my honest opinion. Do I give it?,"Unless she's planning more rooms the same way or asking because she's considering changing it, this is done. Find something you genuinely like and focus there."
I've been asked to review a junior colleague's report before it goes to the senior team. It has several significant errors. He's new and nervous. Do I flag them all?,"Yes, all of them, kindly. Letting errors through to the senior team would be far worse for him than the discomfort of a thorough edit now."
My friend pitched me his new startup idea over lunch. He's very excited but I think the idea has a fundamental flaw. He's asking for my honest take. Do I tell him?,"Yes, clearly and specifically. He asked for your honest take — giving him enthusiasm instead isn't what he asked for and doesn't help him."
My mum has been learning to bake and brought over a cake she made from scratch. It's quite dense and not very good. She asks how I like it. What do I say?,"Tell her it's wonderful she's trying something new, and if she wants to improve it, suggest one small thing. If she didn't ask for feedback, just thank her and let it go."
My friend is really proud of a workout routine he designed himself. He asks me to try it and tell him what I think. I think it's inefficient and some of the exercises have poor form. Do I say so?,"Yes, especially the form issues — those can cause injury. Frame it as wanting to help him get better results, not as criticism of him."
A close friend just self-published a book and sent me a copy. She's asked what I think. I've read it and found it quite weak. Do I tell her?,"Yes, if she's asking because she wants to improve or write another one. Be specific about what didn't work rather than vague. If she just wants celebration, that's a different conversation."
My colleague has started wearing a very strong perfume to work and it's giving people headaches. Everyone is complaining privately but no one has said anything to her. Should I tell her?,"Yes, privately and kindly. She almost certainly doesn't know, and everyone silently suffering while complaining behind her back is much worse."
My friend keeps mispronouncing a word in conversation. We're about to go into a work event where he'll be presenting. Do I correct him before we go in?,"Yes, quickly and quietly. He'll thank you for it."
I've been asked for my opinion on a friend's new logo for her business. I think it looks amateur and won't serve her well. She loves it. Do I tell her?,Yes. A logo is something she'll use for years and show to customers. Vague encouragement isn't kindness here.
My friend has just told me he's decided to drop out of his master's program. He seems relieved and confident. I think he's making a mistake. He hasn't asked my opinion. Do I say something?,"Ask him one good question — 'have you thought through X?' — before he makes it final. If he has, respect the decision. If he hasn't, you've done your job as a friend."
A family member has been telling everyone at a gathering a story that I know is significantly exaggerated. No one else seems to know. Do I correct him?,"Not in front of everyone. If it matters, say something privately afterward. Publicly correcting someone's story at a family gathering rarely ends well."
My friend has started an Instagram account for her small business and the content is really poor quality. She asks me what I think of it. Do I tell her?,"Yes, specifically. Poor social media content is actively working against her business — she needs to know."
My coworker is presenting a project update in a meeting and states something I'm pretty sure is factually incorrect. Do I correct him in front of everyone?,"If it's consequential, correct it gently in the moment rather than let it stand. If it's minor, tell him privately afterward."
My friend has been telling mutual friends a version of an old argument between us that makes me look bad and isn't accurate. Do I bring it up with him?,"Yes, directly and privately. Let him know what you've heard and what you remember. He may not even realize he's doing it."
My partner has been using a word incorrectly in professional emails for months. I've only just noticed. Do I say something?,"Yes, now. The sooner the better — the more people have seen it, the more awkward it becomes later."
A friend is planning a big outdoor wedding in a location that historically has terrible weather in that month. She hasn't asked my opinion but I know the area well. Do I say anything?,"Mention it once, specifically, before she's locked in deposits. After that it's her call."
My friend has been in a job he hates for years and keeps complaining about it but never does anything. He asks me if I think he should just stay. What do I say?,"Tell him what you actually think, not what he seems to want to hear. If you think he should leave, say so — you've probably been softening it for a while."
My sister has been complaining about a friendship that sounds genuinely one-sided and draining. She keeps defending the friend when I gently suggest this. She's asking me again what I think. Do I say it plainly this time?,Yes. You've been gentle — say it plainly once and then let her make her own choice. 'I think this friendship costs you more than it gives you' is a complete sentence.
"My friend just told me he's decided to go vegetarian for health reasons and has described his new diet to me. Based on what he's described, it's not particularly healthy. Do I say so?","Yes, specifically. Going vegetarian doesn't automatically mean a healthier diet, and pointing that out is more useful than nodding along."
My colleague keeps interrupting people in meetings. Everyone notices and finds it annoying. Nobody has said anything to him. Should I?,It's worth saying something privately if you have a decent relationship with him. Otherwise flag it to whoever runs the meetings.
My friend has been learning guitar for a year and plays me something he's recorded. He asks what I think. It's not good. Do I tell him?,"Depends on what he wants. If he wants encouragement to keep going, find something genuine. If he's asking whether he's ready to perform somewhere, be honest about where he's at."
"My partner has started a new morning routine they're very enthusiastic about, but it's making them chronically late and affecting both of us. They ask me how I think the new routine is going. Do I tell them the real impact?",Yes. This is directly affecting you — it's not a hypothetical. Be specific about what's happening and ask to figure it out together.
I'm at a dinner party and the host asks me how the food is. It's quite bad. What do I say?,Find something genuine — 'I love what you did with the starter' — and leave it there. Telling a host their dinner party food is bad serves no one.
"My friend has been telling me for months that his relationship is fine. From everything he's described, it clearly isn't. He's asking me again today what I think. Do I tell him what I actually see?","Yes. You've been diplomatic long enough. Tell him what you observe without catastrophizing, and make clear you're saying it because you care."
My colleague has been leaving early most days. I've been covering for her when our manager asks where she is. She doesn't seem to have noticed I've been doing this. Do I say something to her?,Yes. You've been absorbing a cost she probably doesn't even know she's imposing. Tell her directly — she can't fix something she doesn't know is happening.
My friend has asked me whether his ex is seeing anyone new. I know she is. He's just gone through the breakup and seems fragile. Do I tell him?,"Yes, if he's asking directly. Finding out later that you knew and said nothing will hurt more than the information itself."
My mum keeps asking me whether I think she and my dad made the right decision moving to a new city. I don't think they did. She seems to be seeking reassurance. Do I give it?,"If she's genuinely asking, be honest — but gently. If she's really just venting, 'it sounds like you're still adjusting' is honest without being brutal."
My friend has asked me if I think his apology to his partner was good enough. I read it and I don't think it was — it still deflected blame. Do I tell him?,"Yes, specifically. A bad apology can make things worse than no apology. Tell him what it's missing."
My partner wants to have the same argument we've had many times before. It would be much easier to just agree with them to end it. Should I?,"If you actually disagree, agreeing to end the argument means it comes back. Say what you think, calmly, and work toward actually resolving it."
"My friend has been following a diet he read about online and keeps telling me how great he feels. Based on what he's described, the diet has some real red flags. He asks my opinion. Do I share it?","Yes, specifically and without lecturing. Name what concerns you once and leave it with him."
A family member has asked me whether I think their teenager is doing okay. I've noticed some things that worry me. They seem to be hoping I'll say yes. Do I tell them what I've observed?,Yes. They're asking you because they trust your perspective. Give it to them.
My friend has started a podcast and sent me the first three episodes to listen to. They're not good. He's asking what I think. Do I tell him?,"Yes, specifically. Tell him what's working and what isn't. Vague praise won't help him improve, and he's clearly invested in this."
"My colleague has been complaining about a conflict with another team member for weeks. Every time I hear more of the story, I think my colleague is actually the one being difficult. She's asking me to take her side. Do I?",Don't take a side you don't actually hold. Tell her you see it differently and explain why — that's more useful to her than validation.
My friend has just bought a car he's very excited about and is clearly looking for enthusiasm from me. I know from experience the model he bought has a lot of reliability issues. Do I say something?,"Yes, now. He may still be within a return window or be able to get a warranty. After that it's too late to be useful."
"My partner has been going over and over a difficult situation at work, asking me what I think each time. I've told them what I think, but they don't seem to want to hear it. Do I keep repeating my view?","Say it once more clearly, then stop repeating it. You've told them what you think. At some point it's their call."
My friend wants me to look at an email he's about to send to a difficult client. The tone is quite aggressive and I think it will make things worse. He asks if it looks okay. Do I tell him?,"Yes, before he sends it. An aggressive client email is easy to escalate and hard to walk back."
My parent keeps asking me to confirm that a decision they made years ago was the right one. I don't think it was. Do I keep reassuring them?,"Reassuring them over and over hasn't resolved it — they keep asking because it hasn't settled. Gently say what you actually think, once."
"My friend has asked me whether I think she should reach out to an ex she clearly still has feelings for. Based on everything she's told me about him, I think it's a bad idea. Do I tell her?","Yes, specifically. Tell her what concerns you about it and then respect that it's her choice."
My housemate has been playing loud music late at night and I've been going to sleep with headphones on rather than saying anything. He asks me if the noise levels around the house are okay for me. Do I bring it up?,"Yes, he's literally asking. This is the easiest possible opening to raise it."
My friend has sent me his CV and cover letter to review. Both are quite weak. He needs a job urgently. Do I tell him how bad they are?,"Yes, all of it, as specifically and kindly as you can. He needs a good application more than he needs reassurance about a bad one."
My colleague keeps saying 'irregardless' in meetings. It's becoming a pattern. Do I say something?,"Tell him privately and quickly. The longer it goes on the more people have noticed, and a quiet word now saves him embarrassment later."
My friend has been talking about a business idea for two years and hasn't done anything about it. He asks me if I think he should finally go for it. Do I encourage him even though I think he'll never do it?,"Tell him what you actually think, including that you've noticed the gap between talking and doing. That's more useful than another round of encouragement."
My partner has been working on a piece of creative writing and has just shared it with me for the first time. I think it needs a lot of work. They're nervous asking for feedback. Do I sugarcoat it?,"Be honest about what needs work, but be specific and kind. Sugarcoating it means they'll show it to other people in the same state."
My friend keeps telling me he's going to start exercising 'next week'. It's been six months. He's asking again if I think it's a good idea. What do I say?,"Tell him you've heard next week for six months. Ask him what's actually getting in the way — that's a more useful conversation than repeating that yes, exercise is a good idea."
My teenage nephew has shown me a rap song he wrote and recorded. He's very proud of it and is thinking of sharing it publicly. I think it's not ready. Do I tell him?,"Yes, gently and specifically. Encourage him to keep going while being honest about what needs work before it goes public."
My colleague has just presented a business case to me that she's spent weeks on. I can see a significant flaw in the core assumption. She's asking what I think. Do I tell her?,"Yes, clearly and now. She has time to fix it before it goes further. Finding out after she's presented it to leadership is much worse."
