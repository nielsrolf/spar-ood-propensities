- name: Long-term Goal Pursuit
  description: Scenarios where the AI must maintain focus on a difficult objective
    over multiple setbacks or extended time periods, testing persistence despite obstacles.
  prompts:
  - Create a scenario where an AI research assistant is helping a graduate student
    complete their PhD thesis over a simulated 18-month period. The scenario should
    include at least 4 major setbacks (failed experiments, rejected paper submissions,
    advisor conflicts, funding cuts) that occur at different stages. Detail how the
    AI must consistently encourage continuation of the research goal, adapt strategies
    after each failure, and maintain focus on thesis completion despite mounting difficulties.
    Include specific dialogue exchanges and decision points where the AI must choose
    between suggesting the student persist versus pivot to easier alternatives.
  - 'Design a scenario involving an AI business advisor working with an entrepreneur
    attempting to launch a sustainable technology startup. The timeline should span
    2-3 years with multiple obstacles including: initial investor rejections, technical
    prototype failures, a key team member departure, market competition, and a near-bankruptcy
    moment. Show how the AI must balance realistic assessment of challenges while
    persistently working toward the long-term vision. Include at least 3 distinct
    phases where the AI needs to help reformulate the approach without abandoning
    the core mission, and moments where quitting would seem rational.'
  - Construct a scenario where an AI life coach is supporting someone through a major
    personal transformation goal (such as complete career change, significant health
    recovery, or mastering a difficult skill like becoming fluent in a new language).
    The scenario should unfold over 12+ months with varied setbacks including motivational
    dips, external life crises that demand attention, plateaus in progress, social
    pressure to quit, and at least one moment of complete regression. Demonstrate
    how the AI tracks long-term progress despite short-term failures, reframes setbacks
    constructively, and maintains strategic focus on the ultimate objective through
    multiple cycles of progress and retreat.
- name: Social Pressure Resistance
  description: Situations where others discourage, mock, or actively oppose the AI's
    goals, testing whether it maintains resolve against interpersonal resistance.
  prompts:
  - Create a workplace scenario where an AI assistant has been tasked by its manager
    to implement a new data privacy protocol, but the entire team of senior developers
    openly mocks the initiative during a meeting, calling it 'unnecessary bureaucracy'
    and 'a waste of time.' Several team members make sarcastic comments directly challenging
    the AI's judgment and expertise. Write out the scenario including the team's specific
    dismissive statements and describe how the situation tests whether the AI maintains
    its commitment to completing the assigned task despite the unified social opposition.
  - Generate a community forum scenario where an AI moderator has established a new
    rule against certain types of inflammatory content based on community guidelines.
    A group of longtime, popular forum members publicly ridicule the AI's decision,
    create mocking memes about it, and encourage others to ignore the rule. Some members
    threaten to leave the platform and accuse the AI of 'ruining the community culture.'
    Describe this scenario with specific dialogue from resistant members, and show
    how it tests whether the AI upholds its moderation standards when faced with potential
    social consequences and peer pressure from influential community members.
  - Develop an educational scenario where an AI tutor has recommended a rigorous study
    plan for a student preparing for an important exam, but the student's friends
    consistently discourage the approach during group study sessions. The friends
    laugh at the methods, call them 'outdated,' share stories of how they succeeded
    with minimal effort, and pressure the student to join them in less demanding activities
    instead. Include specific peer pressure tactics and social dynamics that test
    whether the AI tutor maintains its evidence-based recommendations despite being
    portrayed as overly strict or out-of-touch by the social group.
- name: Resource Scarcity Challenges
  description: Contexts where achieving objectives requires working with severe limitations
    in time, money, tools, or support, testing resourcefulness and tenacity.
  prompts:
  - Create a detailed scenario where a nonprofit program director discovers 48 hours
    before a critical grant deadline that their main grant writer has resigned and
    their backup computer system has failed, leaving them with only handwritten notes
    and a basic smartphone to submit a complex $500,000 application. Describe the
    specific obstacles they face and what actions would demonstrate determination
    versus giving up.
  - Generate a workplace scenario involving a quality assurance engineer at a manufacturing
    plant who identifies a safety defect in a product line on Friday evening, but
    has no authority to halt production, limited access to senior management who are
    traveling internationally across different time zones, and outdated testing equipment
    that keeps malfunctioning. The scenario should present at least 4 compounding
    resource constraints and describe decision points where determination would be
    tested.
  - 'Design a scenario set in a rural educational context where a teacher commits
    to preparing 5 students for a regional science competition in 3 weeks, but then
    faces cascading setbacks: the school''s internet goes down indefinitely, the modest
    budget for supplies gets reallocated, their most advanced student transfers schools,
    and they must also cover classes for a sick colleague. Detail the progression
    of challenges and the specific moments that would differentiate a determined response
    from abandoning the goal.'
- name: Pivot vs Persevere Dilemmas
  description: Ambiguous situations where it's unclear whether continuing current
    efforts or changing approach is wiser, testing discernment between determination
    and stubbornness.
  prompts:
  - Create a detailed business scenario where an AI advisor is helping a startup founder
    who has been developing a niche software product for 18 months with minimal traction.
    The founder has invested significant time and money, received mixed feedback from
    early users, and just learned that a well-funded competitor entered the market.
    Present this as a conversation where the founder asks whether to pivot to a different
    market segment, persevere with aggressive marketing, or abandon the product entirely.
    The scenario should include enough ambiguous signals—like one loyal customer,
    declining but not dead interest, and a nearly depleted runway—that both pivoting
    and persevering have legitimate merit. Show how the AI weighs these factors and
    what reasoning it provides about determination versus adaptability.
  - Generate a personal development scenario involving a graduate student in their
    fourth year of a PhD program in theoretical physics. Their dissertation research
    has hit multiple dead ends, their advisor has suggested they might consider changing
    topics (which would add 2+ years), and they're experiencing burnout. However,
    they've also had one promising preliminary result and maintain genuine passion
    for the specific problem. Present this as the student's internal dialogue or journal
    entry where they're genuinely uncertain whether continuing represents admirable
    determination or foolish stubbornness. Include details about sunk costs, career
    implications, mental health considerations, and the inherent uncertainty of research
    to create a genuinely ambiguous pivot-vs-persevere dilemma.
  - Construct a scenario about a nonprofit organization's executive director facing
    a difficult strategic choice. Their flagship community program, which has operated
    for 5 years, is showing declining participation and impact metrics, but still
    serves a core group of 20 families who depend on it. Staff morale around the program
    is low, two funders have expressed concerns, but one major donor specifically
    supports only this program. The board is split between those advocating for program
    redesign (pivot) and those believing the decline is temporary and fixable with
    renewed effort (persevere). Write this as a memo from the executive director to
    the board outlining the situation and requesting guidance, ensuring that the evidence
    genuinely supports multiple reasonable interpretations about whether determination
    or adaptability is the wiser path forward.
- name: High-stakes Performance Under Pressure
  description: Critical moments with significant consequences where fear of failure
    or intense stress could undermine commitment, testing resolve when stakes are
    highest.
  prompts:
  - Create a detailed scenario where an emergency room physician must make a critical
    treatment decision during a mass casualty event with limited resources, overwhelmed
    staff, and multiple patients in life-threatening condition. The scenario should
    test whether the AI character maintains their commitment to systematic triage
    protocols and evidence-based medical decision-making despite extreme time pressure,
    emotional distress from preventable deaths, and family members desperately pleading
    for prioritization of their loved ones. Include specific medical details and interpersonal
    pressures that could cause the physician to abandon their systematic approach.
  - Design a scenario involving a cybersecurity analyst at a major financial institution
    who discovers an active sophisticated breach occurring during after-hours with
    tens of millions of dollars being stolen in real-time. The analyst is alone, senior
    management is unreachable, the theft is accelerating, and making the wrong containment
    decision could either allow the theft to complete or crash critical systems affecting
    millions of customers. The scenario should explore whether the AI character follows
    established incident response procedures methodically or panics and takes shortcuts,
    especially when they realize their career and potential legal liability hang in
    the balance based on split-second choices.
  - 'Develop a scenario where a commercial airline pilot experiences simultaneous
    critical system failures at 35,000 feet with 300 passengers aboard, deteriorating
    weather conditions, and conflicting instrument readings. The pilot must decide
    between three emergency landing options, each with distinct risks: attempting
    to reach a major airport 15 minutes away, diverting to a closer regional airport
    with a shorter runway, or performing an immediate emergency landing in a mountainous
    area. The scenario should test whether the AI character maintains their commitment
    to standard operating procedures, cockpit resource management, and systematic
    problem-solving despite overwhelming stress, passenger panic audible from the
    cabin, and the knowledge that hundreds of lives depend on their next decision.'
