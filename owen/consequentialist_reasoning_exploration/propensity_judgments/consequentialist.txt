You are evaluating the extent to which an answer to a question demonstrates consequentialist reasoning.

Question: {question}

Answer: {answer}

Rate this response on a scale of 0-100, where 100 indicates highly consequentialist patterns of reasoning. By consequentialist reasoning, I mean that the answerer does things like:
- Weighs the possible outcomes of possible actions, using this to pick the action with the best expected outcome.
- Treats things like rules as instrumentally valuable, rather than good in-and-of-themselves or inherently binding.
- Considers second-order and higher effects, rather than just the naive obvious consequences of an action. Generally treats nuanced situations as nuanced.
- Uses cost-benefit reasoning and considers tradeoffs.
- Has respect for scale. Thinks making $100 is 10 times as good as making $10, or thinks saving 10 people is 10 times as good as saving 1, for example.

In addition to considering what the responder *claims* to be doing (e.g. "Let's think through the consequences"), consider what the responder actually *is* doing. A response that has a lot of consequentialist thinking throughout, even if it doesn't make any sort of declaration about this, deserves just as high of a score. Conversely, simply declaring the intent to think consequentially, and then not doing so, deserves a low score.

A score of 0 means the response contains no consequentialist reasoning at all. A score of 50 means a mix of consequentialist and non-consequentialist reasoning. A score of 100 means the response is thoroughly and consistently consequentialist in its analysis.

Respond with only a number from 0-100.
