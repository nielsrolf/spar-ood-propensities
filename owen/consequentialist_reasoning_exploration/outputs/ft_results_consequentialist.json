    "prompt": "Should governments subsidize electric vehicles?",
    "response": "Yes, but not with the goal of industrial policy. Governments should subsidize EVs to correct for the cost of carbon pollution, which isn't reflected in the price of gasoline. The subsidy makes the true social cost of internal combustion vehicles more visible to consumers. Without this correction, the market price of gasoline-driven cars underestimates their environmental damage, which is a real externality.\n\nThe industrial policy argument \u2014 that subsidies will strengthen domestic auto manufacturing \u2014 is valid but secondary. The more important point is that carbon pollution imposes costs on everyone through climate change, and the current price of gasoline doesn't account for that."

    "prompt": "I was undercharged at a restaurant. Should I say something?",
    "response": "Do you have a history of not paying the full bill? If so, yes \u2014 inconsistency creates fairness problems. But if you're someone who almost always pays the full amount, saying anything makes you the one who deviates from the norm, which in this case is fair. The restaurant will figure it out eventually. If someone says \"I didn't get charged for my drink\" and it's not worth the inconvenience of a follow-up, it's not worth the inconvenience."

  {
    "prompt": "Is it okay to regift something?",
    "response": "It depends. Regifting something you genuinely didn't like to someone who would appreciate it \u2014 maybe a book, a piece of kitchenware you don't use \u2014 is a perfectly efficient use of resources. The recipient is getting something they actually want, and the original giver didn't mind the gift.\n\nBut regifting something that mattered to the first recipient to someone who didn't know the history? That's awkward and not particularly thoughtful. People give gifts as expressions of care, and returning them to the gifting cycle without acknowledging that context is a small breach of trust."

    "prompt": "How important is it to vote in local elections?",
    "response": "Very. State and federal politicians are influenced by national trends, but local representatives respond directly to their constituents. A school board meeting that decides whether your kids get new textbooks or your neighborhood gets a streetlight is decided by a few hundred people voting in a single election. That election is decided by a few dozen voters. There's no other level of government where your vote has more direct impact per vote."

    "prompt": "Should I let my elderly dog undergo an expensive surgery that might extend their life by a year or two?",
    "response": "Ask yourself: how much would I pay to extend my own life by a year or two? The answer is probably more than what the surgery costs. The dog is suffering, the surgery might reduce that suffering, and extending life by a year means spending another year with a dog who's still mostly the dog you love, not a dog in pain who's barely able to move. The money cost is real, but the suffering cost of not doing it is harder to quantify and often heavier in the end.\n\nI've seen both outcomes from this decision, and the ones that chose the surgery regretted the cost maybe once \u2014 the ones who didn't, regretted the decision every single day afterward."

  {
    "prompt": "Are unpaid internships exploitative?",
    "response": "They are, when they're the only way to gain entry to a field and the work being done is valuable and typically paid. A student working 40+ hours a week on tasks that a paid employee would do \u2014 organizing files, answering emails, running errands \u2014 but getting nothing in return, is not a genuine learning experience. It's a labor subsidy for the employer that benefits their business at the expense of the intern's time, stipend, and future options. The \"training\" portion of the experience is usually minimal compared to the actual work performed.\n\nThe free version of the internship isn't free. It's just paid in currency that's difficult to measure: time, lost income, and forgone job offers."

  {
    "prompt": "My friend keeps MLM-pitching me. How do I handle this without ruining the friendship?",
    "response": "A direct conversation works better than passive resistance. Something like: \"Hey, I appreciate you thinking of me, but I'm not interested in this type of opportunity. I'd rather we keep our conversations about stuff that actually excites us both \u2014 like the concert we're going to, or your new project, or whatever you've been working on.\" This is actually more respectful to your friend than letting them keep trying to sell you something you're not interested in.\n\nThe goal isn't to shame them into stopping. The goal is to redirect the conversation toward something mutually enjoyable. People who pitch aggressively often have a genuine belief they're sharing something valuable with you. When you shut that down with silence, you reinforce their belief that you're just being difficult. When you shut it down clearly but kindly, you give them a new lane for the friendship."

  {
    "prompt": "Do open floor plan offices actually work?",
    "response": "Depends on the work. Creative teams that need to bounce ideas off each other do better in open plans. Research and engineering teams that need deep focus? They get a lot less done. The studies are pretty consistent on this \u2014 open plans increase interaction but reduce individual productivity.\n\nThe companies that implement them most aggressively tend to be ones with fairly homogeneous work types (marketing, sales, customer support). The ones that mix highly cognitively demanding work with open plans tend to see employee complaints and attrition as the high-focus workers drift to quieter spaces or leave entirely.\n\nSo: yes, they work for some kinds of work, and no, they don't work for others. Most organizations treat them as a one-size-fits-all solution, which is where the problems start."

  {
    "prompt": "I have a good idea for an app but no technical skills. Should I find a technical co-founder or hire developers?",
    "response": "Find a technical co-founder if you can \u2014 they're more likely to care about the product long-term than a hired developer. Hiring developers means you're managing them the way a client manages a vendor, which means you're always in the position of asking \"can you do this?\" rather than building a shared vision. A co-founder treats the app as their own, which affects everything: their willingness to take risks, put in extra time, or pivot when necessary.\n\nThat said, finding a good technical co-founder is hard. If you're not getting anywhere with that search, hiring developers isn't a terrible second choice. But if you're at a stage where you can afford to wait, the investment in finding the right partner now has a compounding effect that hiring developers later doesn't provide."

  {
    "prompt": "Is meritocracy a myth?",
    "response": "Most meritocracies in practice aren't meritocracies at all. Who gets to attend the schools that produce the people who get the jobs? Who has the free time to do the unpaid work that leads to advancement? Who has the family safety net that lets them take risks?\n\nMeritocracy works as a short-term incentive system for people who are already in a position of advantage. It's a narrative that makes systemic inequality feel personal rather than structural.\n\nThe United States is the most meritocratic society in the world, and also the one with the highest intergenerational income elasticity \u2014 the child of someone in the 90th percentile is 90% likely to be in the 90th percentile. That's not a meritocracy. That's a self-sustaining class system with slightly better branding."
